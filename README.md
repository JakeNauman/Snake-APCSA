# Snake-APCSA
Project for 11th grade AP CSA class. 
Through this I learned how to use graphics in Java and some other Java skills.
I mostly followed a tutorial online so this was mostly to learn. Not show anything off.

Edit: Dont even bother looking at this, I'm not even sure it works and I made hardly any of it.
